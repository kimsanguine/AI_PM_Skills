# hplan — The Product Build Gate for AI Agents

> **The 30-minute check that stops you from spending 6 months building the wrong AI product.**

> 🐎 **What `hplan` means — Harness Planning.**
> Like a horse's harness, hplan gives direction to the raw power of AI coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Lovable, etc.). The tools that *make* code are already strong enough. What's missing is *where to point them*. hplan is the 7-day discipline that forces you to answer market research, problem definition, and COGS *before* a single PRD line is written.

> **v0.8.4** — hplan is the **Product Build Gate** that asks WHETHER before AI tools rush to HOW. v0.8 layers two new plugins on top of the gate: **`track`** (build-time guardrail — prompt-level progress + event-driven blockers + α/β/γ respect-checkpoint) and **`craft`** (design-system enforcement — DESIGN.md + RESPECT.md + Playwright runtime measurement). Together: **Build Gate before you build, Track while you build** — wrong directions blocked at both layers. 3 rounds of adversarial review (4 → 3 → 1 findings, 0 high remaining). See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## The Problem hplan Solves

You have an AI product idea. Cursor can prototype it in a weekend. Spec-Kit can spec it in an hour. Claude Code can ship a first version overnight.

**But should you build it?**

Every AI tool today is great at making things *fast*. None of them ask whether the thing should exist at all. So PMs and founders end up:

- 🪦 Building products customers don't actually want (waitlists and "I would use this" aren't evidence)
- 💸 Promising "unlimited AI" pricing that quietly loses money at scale (Replit went from $2M ARR to single-digit margins this way)
- 🔁 Re-pitching the same idea their team killed 3 months ago — and nobody remembers why
- 📋 Confidently shipping clones of established incumbents without realizing the territory is taken
- 🤷 Making "build" or "hold" decisions and never finding out which ones were actually right

**hplan is the 30-minute proof that your next 6 months will work.** It's the discipline of saying "let me check first" — encoded as deterministic tools, not just good intentions.

## How hplan Shows Up in Your Day

This is what changes once hplan is installed. You keep talking to Claude the way you already do — hplan steps in at the moments you most often slip up:

| You say to Claude | What hplan does |
|---|---|
| **"Let's build an AI assistant for our customers"** | hplan pauses and asks for the evidence. *"Which users currently spend 30+ min/week on this? Show me 3 real customer quotes."* If you can't, it stops you before any PRD work. |
| **"We'll charge $19/month for this AI feature"** | hplan runs the COGS calculation with real provider pricing, your expected usage, and a free-tier abuse scenario. Returns *p50 margin: 78%, p90: 41%, with free abuse: −12%*. Tells you exactly what needs to change. |
| **"This is similar to the idea Alex pitched last quarter"** | hplan checks the decision log. *"Yes — that idea was held on 2026-02-03 because [reasons]. The condition to revisit was 'enterprise customers explicitly ask'. Is that condition met now?"* |
| **"It's an AI tool that helps marketers write copy"** | hplan checks the exclusions registry first. *"This overlaps with prior exclusion ex-2026-04-17: established incumbents already cover this. Reopen trigger was 'serve a vertical with regulatory copy requirements'. Do you?"* |
| **"Spec it out so we can start building"** | hplan blocks the write until all three gates are green. If Evidence Gate said "interview" and COGS said "RED", the spec file simply does not get created. Filesystem-level block, not a polite warning. |
| **"Were my product decisions actually right?"** | hplan audits the last 6–12 months automatically. *"You held 8 ideas. 6 turned out to be correctly killed (validated). 2 someone else shipped successfully — those are 'false holds'. Here's what those 2 had in common."* |

The pattern: **you don't have to remember to invoke hplan.** Once installed, it triggers when you say things like "let's build", "we'll charge", "ship it", "spec it out".

## Who This Is For

- **Solo founders** deciding what to spend the next 6 months building
- **Product managers** who keep getting asked "can we build this with AI?" and want a structured way to answer
- **Teams using Spec-Kit / Cursor / Kiro / Claude Code** who want a *pre-spec filter* — not a replacement
- **Anyone** who has shipped something that looked good on paper and died in production, and wants the next idea to go differently

## WHETHER — The Question Every Other Tool Skips

> **"AI 코딩 도구가 HOW를 잘하게 됐다면, hplan은 WHETHER를 다룬다. 둘은 같이 쓰는 것이 아니라 순서가 있다 — hplan이 먼저다."**
>
> *"If AI coding tools have mastered HOW, hplan handles WHETHER. They're not used together — there's an order. hplan goes first."*

**HOW** asks: *"In what way should we build this?"*
**WHETHER** asks: *"Should we build this at all — yes or no?"*

WHETHER is bigger than WHY. WHY answers the reason ("why would users pay?"). WHETHER is the binary verdict that *contains* WHY — every gate in hplan answers a WHY question, and together they produce the WHETHER:

| Gate | WHY it answers | WHETHER it produces |
|------|---------------|---------------------|
| Evidence Rubric | Why do users actually have this problem? | Do we have sufficient proof to proceed? |
| Exclusions Check | Why did we kill this idea before? | Is this iteration meaningfully different? |
| COGS Sentinel | Why would this pricing work at scale? | Can the economics support a real business? |
| **All 3 combined** | — | **GO / HOLD / INVESTIGATE** |

Other tools handle **HOW** (superpowers → how to work with Claude Code), **WHO** (gstack → who the agents are), **WHERE** (GSD → where in the workflow). hplan handles **WHETHER** — the decision that comes before all other decisions.

### hplan's 3 Principles vs Opposing Assumptions

| hplan 원칙 | 대립 가정 |
|-----------|---------|
| **대화↓ 고객문서↑** — 고객·시장·경쟁사에 대한 문서가 많을수록 LLM이 더 정확하게 돕는다 | LLM과 대화를 더 많이 할수록 결과가 개선된다 |
| **큰 작업은 단계별로** — 검증되지 않은 전제를 컨텍스트에 쌓지 않는다 | 한 번에 큰 컨텍스트를 주면 LLM이 더 잘 이해한다 |
| **검증 먼저·개발 나중** — 증거 없이 PRD를 쓰는 것은 기술적 부채의 시작이다 | 빠른 프로토타입을 만들어보면 검증된다 |

## Under the Hood

For the technically curious, here's what makes hplan different from every other PM toolkit:

- 🧪 **Executable COGS sentinel** — p50 / p90 monthly margin is computed by a real Python sampler with provider pricing snapshots, not estimated by an LLM. Free-user abuse is modeled, not hand-waved.
- 📚 **Append-only exclusions registry** — every "Do Not Build" gets a JSONL entry with a `reopen_trigger`. New ideas auto-collision-check with Korean-aware fuzzy match.
- 📊 **Self-evaluating decision log** — every gate decision is logged with reasons; outcomes are back-filled later; an `audit` command surfaces hit rate, false holds, and missed builds. The only PM gate that measures its own accuracy.
- 🔌 **MCP server** — the same gate primitives are exposed as MCP tools, so Cursor / Windsurf / Kiro / Codex / Goose can call them, not just Claude Code.
- 🛑 **Claude Code PreToolUse hook** — blocks writes to `PRD.md` / `specs/*` / `.kiro/specs/*` until `harness/build-gate/checkpoint.json` shows `status: "approved"`. Gate enforcement at the filesystem level, not just in prompts.
- 🚚 **Multi-target handoff** — one brief JSON exports simultaneously to Spec-Kit `specs/NNN-slug/`, Kiro `.kiro/specs/`, GStack `/office-hours` brief, and Claude Code `AGENTS.md` + `CLAUDE.md`.

*Renamed from `AI_PM_Skills` in v0.5. The flagship plugin (`hplan`) sits at Stage 0 of a 9-stage marketplace (v0.8 adds `track` + `craft`). Old URLs auto-redirect.*

## The Problem

In 2026, PMs are being asked to "build an agent" — but existing PM skills don't prepare you for that.

General PM skills teach you to **use AI as a tool** — write PRDs faster, generate OKRs, analyze competitors. But when you're **building agents as products**, the questions are fundamentally different:

- "What would it cost to run this agent at 1,000 users/day?"
- "How does an agent recover from hallucination?"
- "How do I orchestrate multiple agents together?"
- "How do I encode 3 months of operational judgment into the agent's instructions?"

This project turns those questions into **62 production-grade skills** across the full agent lifecycle.

---

## Quick Start (60 seconds)

```bash
# 1. Install the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add kimsanguine/hplan
/plugin install hplan@kimsanguine-hplan

# 2. Run all 3 gates in one command — exclusions + evidence + COGS → verdict
/hplan "AI marketing copy generator"
# → [exclusions] COLLISION with ex-2026-04-17 (established incumbents)
# → reopen_trigger UNMET → HOLD

# Or run individual gates for deeper analysis:
/hplan-evidence "AI marketing copy generator"   # full 100-point evidence rubric
/hplan-cogs --provider anthropic --model claude-sonnet-4-6 \
            --tokens-in 3000 --calls 40 --arpu 29
# → p50 margin 95%, p90 90%, blended 49% → GREEN
```

**Already past the gate?** Install one of the 8 lifecycle plugins:

```bash
/plugin install discover@kimsanguine-hplan   # Discover — opportunity trees, assumptions, cost sim
/plugin install architect@kimsanguine-hplan  # Architect — orchestration, memory, moat
/plugin install deliver@kimsanguine-hplan    # Deliver — agent PRD, instructions, prompts
/plugin install measure@kimsanguine-hplan    # Measure — KPI, burn rate, reliability
/plugin install learn@kimsanguine-hplan      # Learn — PM tacit knowledge, decision patterns
/plugin install operate@kimsanguine-hplan    # Operate — 5+ agent portfolio (T1~T5, scorecard, rollup)
/plugin install track@kimsanguine-hplan      # Track ⭐ v0.8 — prompt-level progress, event-driven gates
/plugin install craft@kimsanguine-hplan      # Craft ⭐ v0.8 — DESIGN.md + RESPECT.md design system
```

## The Agent PM Journey — 9 Stages

This isn't a random collection of skills. It's a **complete lifecycle** — the same path every agent PM walks. Starting in v0.5, **`hplan` is Stage 0** — the evidence gate that decides whether the thing should be built at all. v0.7 added **`operate`** as the portfolio stage for teams running 5+ agents. v0.8 adds **`track` + `craft`** as the build-to-ship gap closers — prompt-level progress visibility and mechanical design-system enforcement.

```

### What makes hplan different from the other 8

Other plugins are **prompt-driven thinking** — LLM ponders, you decide.
`hplan` adds **deterministic measurement** — Python scripts calculate p50/p90 COGS margins, append-only registries persist exclusions and decisions across runs, an MCP server lets Cursor/Windsurf/Kiro/Codex call hplan primitives, and a PreToolUse hook blocks PRD/spec writes until the human approves the gate. It is paired with discover/architect/deliver/measure/learn, not a replacement.

Each skill **auto-loads from natural language** — describe your task and the right skill fires. Skills also **route across plugins**: burn-rate (measure) detects a cost spike → suggests router (architect) for model change → triggers cost-sim (discover) for re-simulation.

---

## Why This Is Different — 6 Things No Other Skillset Does

### ① Complete Agent Lifecycle, Not Random Tools

62 skills map to 9 stages of agent product development (Gate → Discover → Architect → Deliver → Measure → Learn → Operate → Track → Craft). This isn't "AI tools for PMs" — it's **a structured methodology for building agents as products**, from discovery to self-improving agents and multi-agent portfolio operations.

### ② Two-Layer Architecture — Platform and Content Separation

We separate **how Claude finds skills** (Platform Layer — Skills 2.0 spec) from **what goes inside each skill** (Content Layer). The Content Layer defines the Trigger Gate (Use/Route/Boundary) pattern that prevents skill collisions, plus domain-specific context in each skill's `context/domain.md`. Result: **97.9% trigger accuracy** across 96 test queries.

```
┌─ Platform Layer ──── Skills 2.0 Spec ──────────────────────┐
│  frontmatter · auto-invocation · subagent · hooks · evals   │
├─ Content Layer ──── hplan Pattern ──────────────────┤
│  Core Goal → Trigger Gate → Failure Handling                │
│  → Quality Gate → Examples · context/domain.md              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### ③ Data Flywheel — PM Tacit Knowledge That Accumulates

learn is the moat. It structures your operational judgment into **TK (Tacit Knowledge) units**, then injects them into agent instructions. The more you use it, the smarter your agents get — and that knowledge **stays yours**.

```
PM judgment notes → /extract → TK-NNN structured units → PM-ENGINE-MEMORY.md
  → /tk-to-instruction → agent system prompt updated → repeat
```

This creates **switching cost**: competitors can copy the framework, but they can't copy your accumulated TK.

### ④ Eval-Driven ROI — Proof, Not Promises

Every skill is measured. 10 quality tests with 54 assertions prove what skills add vs base Claude. Result:

| | With Skill | Without Skill | Delta |
|---|-----------|--------------|-------|
| **Pass Rate** | **100%** | 88% | **+12%** |

`pm-framework` without skill drops to 40%. `cost-sim` with skill adds +46.6% output. This is **data-driven proof** that the skills work.

### ⑤ Good/Bad Examples for Data-Driven Improvement

Every skill includes `examples/good-01.md` and `examples/bad-01.md` — concrete right/wrong output pairs. Plus `references/test-cases.md` with edge case tables. These aren't decorative; they're **training signals** that make skill quality measurable and continuously improvable.

### ⑥ Skills 2.0 Full Spec + Instant Onboarding

Built on Claude Code's latest platform spec: auto-invocation, `context: fork`, `allowed-tools`, `model` field, dynamic `!command` injection, marketplace, and eval system. New users start with the [PM-ENGINE-MEMORY Starter Kit](learn/skills/pm-engine/examples/PM-ENGINE-MEMORY-STARTER.md) — 5 seed TK entries so the value is **immediate**, not "someday when I accumulate enough data."

### ⑦ Three Engineering Layers — The Stack Most AI Toolkits Miss

Most "AI for PMs" tools operate at a single layer: Prompt Engineering — better templates, faster output. hplan is built across three layers that must work together:

| Layer | What it does | hplan tools |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Prompt Engineering** | Structured prompts that extract real signal — not opinion or LLM speculation | evidence-rubric · interview-synthesis · OST · cogs-sentinel |
| **Context Engineering** | *Garbage in, garbage out.* Customer documents, market data, and competitive context enter the system *before* any PRD — not inferred afterward. The exclusions registry and decision-log are institutional memory as permanent, structured context. | exclusions · decision-log · interview-synthesis |
| **Harness Engineering** | Deterministic guardrails enforced at the system level: Python scripts, append-only JSONL registries, a PreToolUse hook that blocks PRD writes at the filesystem. The discipline exists even when you'd rather skip it. | gate_guard.py · cogs_sentinel.py · exclusions_registry.py · MCP server |

> *Prompt Engineering improves HOW you ask. Context Engineering determines WHAT goes in. Harness Engineering enforces WHETHER you proceed.*

A perfect prompt with bad customer data produces confidently wrong conclusions. An excellent evidence rubric means nothing if a developer can bypass it and write the PRD anyway. All three layers are required — and in that order.

| `pm-decision` | Build a pattern library of recurring PM decisions with context, criteria, and known failures | "I've seen this situation before — why did I decide that way?" |
| `pm-engine` | Agents dynamically query TK knowledge graph at runtime + auto-extract 1 TK/day + auto-update instructions | "I want my agents to leverage my operational know-how automatically" |

**Commands:** `/extract` · `/decide` · `/tk-to-instruction`

> Start with the [PM-ENGINE-MEMORY Starter Kit](learn/skills/pm-engine/examples/PM-ENGINE-MEMORY-STARTER.md) — 5 seed TK entries to get going immediately.

> The framework is open-source; your data (PM-ENGINE-MEMORY.md) is your own asset.

<summary><strong>7. operate</strong> — Run a portfolio of AI agents <code>(4 skills, 0 commands)</code></summary>

| Skill | What it does | When to use |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `agent-portfolio` | T1~T5 tiering by Reach × Reliability × Strategic value | "I run 5+ agents — which one deserves next quarter's investment?" |
| `scorecard-5axis` | Weighted scoring across Accuracy / Reliability / Cost / Velocity / User Satisfaction → single comparable number | "Head-to-head agent comparison for weekly ops review" |
| `weekly-rollup` | Cron-driven portfolio rollup (trend + anomaly detection across all agents) | "Monday morning — what changed across my agent fleet?" |
| `cross-team-routing` | Score capability × load × tier × handoff cost to decide which agent serves a request | "3 different agents could handle this — which should take it?" |

> Use case: teams running 5+ agents where single-agent KPIs (measure plugin) no longer reveal priorities.

<summary><strong>8. track</strong> ⭐ v0.8 NEW — Prompt-level progress + event-driven guardrail <code>(7 skills, 3 commands)</code></summary>

| Skill | What it does | When to use |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `velocity-baseline` | Extract personal velocity from prior projects (git log + token usage → complexity × percentile lookup) | "Before estimating, learn how fast I actually code" |
| `estimate-tasks` | WBS decomposition + complexity classification (LLM) + loc/tokens/minutes prediction (deterministic lookup, NO LLM hallucination) | "Lock predicted scope before starting — Rule 5 compliant" |
| `progress-probe` | PostToolUse Hook + shell fallback → append every tool call to `.track/actual_log.jsonl` | "Telemetry on every prompt cycle (defends against issue #17688 silent fail)" |
| `blocker-detect` | 50+ deterministic regex/counter signals (self-doubt, retry loops, test failures, context pressure, stalls) | "Auto-detect when I'm stuck — no LLM, just patterns + thresholds" |
| `progress-report` | 7 event-driven triggers force a current-status report (NOT weekly cadence — that's operate/weekly-rollup) | "Status snapshot at phase transition / blocker threshold / context 70%" |
| `gate-checkpoint` | 6-phase transition gates (requirements → ship) with PreToolUse Hook blocking | "Mechanical enforcement: can't write impl code until design phase passes" |
| `respect-checkpoint` | AI classifies (screen_type × traffic) → deterministic matrix lookup → α (human 7s) + β (72h analytics) + γ (Playwright saliency) gate combination | "Ship-time user-respect gate — '이 존중은 사람이 넣는 겁니다' enforced" |

**Commands:** `/track-init` · `/track-status` · `/track-retro`

> All 7 skills enforce Rule 5 (LLM classification only; routing/policy/metrics deterministic). Two self-contained regression tests: `python3 evals/skill-uplift.py --test` + `python3 scripts/validate-craft-lint.py --test`.

<summary><strong>9. craft</strong> ⭐ v0.8 NEW — DESIGN.md + RESPECT.md design-system enforcement <code>(4 skills, 2 commands)</code></summary>

| Skill | What it does | When to use |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `respect-brief` | Interview-driven RESPECT.md (5 sections: three_second_rule / next_action / social_proof / hierarchy / motion) with forbidden words enforcement | "Before any UI code — capture user-respect intent as YAML constraints" |
| `hierarchy-rules` | Playwright + DOM saliency + pixel KMeans + WCAG AA at runtime (fold density / type hierarchy / 60-30-10 color / whitespace / CTA count) | "Measure what humans actually see — not what tokens promised" |
| `motion-language` | Regex + framer-motion AST scan → drift report against RESPECT motion_language spec | "Hover transitions all 200ms? Page easing consistent? Catch drift before ship" |
| `ui-drift-detect` | 5+ screen pHash + KMeans palette + DOM tree edit distance → 5-dimension drift score | "Design system regression detection — new screen broke the language?" |

**Commands:** `/craft-init` · `/craft-lint`

> Pairs with `scripts/validate-craft-lint.py` (deterministic DESIGN.md + RESPECT.md cross-ref validation). Closes the AI "professionally generic" trap by mechanically enforcing the user-respect layer on top of Google DESIGN.md token spec.

## Installation

### Option 1: GitHub Marketplace (Recommended)

```bash
/plugin marketplace add kimsanguine/hplan
/plugin install hplan@kimsanguine-hplan    # or discover · architect · deliver · measure · learn · operate · track · craft
```

### Option 2: Clone Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kimsanguine/hplan.git
claude --plugin-dir ./hplan/hplan   # pick what you need (hplan, discover, architect, deliver, measure, learn, operate, track, craft)
```

**Not sure which AI product to commit to?** → Start with `hplan` — evidence gate first.
**First time with Claude Code?** → Run `deliver/claude-md` — it scans your project and recommends the right plugins.
**Already past the gate?** → Pick by lifecycle stage (discover → architect → deliver → measure → learn → operate).

### Other AI Tools

<summary><strong>📐 Architecture Deep-Dive</strong> — Two Layers, Skills 2.0, Trigger Gate, Commands</summary>

### Auto-Invocation

You don't call skills by name. Describe your task in natural language, and Claude matches it against each SKILL.md's `description` field to auto-load the best fit. Trigger accuracy: **97.9%** across 96 test queries.

### Cross-Plugin Routing

The Trigger Gate's "Route" field enables routing between plugins:

| From | Trigger Condition | Route To |
|------|------------------|----------|
| `opp-tree` | "Validate assumptions for top opportunity" | `assumptions` |
| `burn-rate` | "Need model routing change" | `router` |
| `prd` | "Need instruction design" | `instruction` |
| `pm-framework` | "Convert TK to agent instruction" | `pm-engine` |

### Command Chaining

| Command | Chained Skills | Plugin |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| `/hplan` ⭐ | exclusions → evidence-rubric → cogs-sentinel → verdict | hplan |
| `/discover` | opp-tree → assumptions → build-or-buy | discover |
| `/architecture` | orchestration → 3-tier → memory-arch | architect |
| `/write-prd` | prd → instruction → ctx-budget | deliver |
| `/health-check` | kpi → reliability → burn-rate | measure |
| `/tk-to-instruction` | pm-engine → instruction | learn+deliver |

### Skills 1.0 vs Skills 2.0

| Feature | 1.0 (2025) | 2.0 (2026) | hplan |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Auto-invocation | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ 97.9% |
| Subagent (`context: fork`) | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ 5 skills |
| Tool restriction | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ 3-tier |
| Marketplace + Evals | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ Full |
| Dynamic injection | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ 5 skills |
| Hooks | ❌ | ✅ | ⚠️ Spec-ready |

> ⚠️ `hooks` have a known issue ([#17688](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/17688)). Fallback `validate_*.sh` scripts available in `references/`.

### Skill Anatomy — What's Inside Each Skill

Every skill follows a consistent internal structure. This isn't just Skills 2.0 spec compliance — it's a **content architecture** designed for measurable quality and continuous improvement:

```
discover/skills/opp-tree/           ← example skill
├── SKILL.md                      ← Core: frontmatter (name, description,
│                                    argument-hint, allowed-tools) +
│                                    Trigger Gate (Use/Route/Boundary) +
│                                    Failure Handling + Quality Gate
├── context/
│   └── domain.md                 ← Domain knowledge injected at runtime
│                                    (e.g., agent economics, industry benchmarks)
├── examples/
│   ├── good-01.md                ← ✅ Reference output — "this is what great looks like"
│   └── bad-01.md                 ← ❌ Anti-pattern — "this is what to avoid and why"
└── references/
    ├── test-cases.md             ← Edge cases, boundary conditions, eval criteria
    └── troubleshooting.md        ← Common failures + recovery patterns
```

**Why this matters:**

| Component | Purpose | Impact |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| `SKILL.md` Trigger Gate | Use/Route/Boundary → prevents wrong skill from firing | 97.9% trigger accuracy |
| `context/domain.md` | Domain expertise Claude doesn't have natively | +12~46% output quality |
| `examples/good-01.md` | Concrete "gold standard" output | Anchors Claude's generation |
| `examples/bad-01.md` | Explicit anti-patterns with explanations | Prevents common failures |
| `references/test-cases.md` | Edge cases + assertions | Powers eval system (54 assertions) |

This pattern repeats across all 62 skills — **200+ supporting files** that make each skill measurable, testable, and improvable.
