## [0.6.0] — 2026-05-11

### Breaking — 5 plugins renamed to PM standard vocabulary

The original Greek-mythology names (oracle / atlas / forge / argus / muse) were chosen for memorability in v0.3 but caused two problems:
- New users had to learn what each mythology name meant
- They didn't match the vocabulary PMs actually use (Double Diamond, Lean Startup, Teresa Torres CDH)

v0.6 renames each plugin to a PM lifecycle word everyone recognizes:

| Old | New | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `oracle` | `discover` | Continuous discovery / Double Diamond's first D |
| `atlas` | `architect` | System architecture, not UI design (avoids "design = UI" confusion) |
| `forge` | `deliver` | Double Diamond's Deliver phase |
| `argus` | `measure` | Lean Startup's Build–Measure–Learn |
| `muse` | `learn` | Lean Startup's Build–Measure–Learn |

`hplan` (Gate) is unchanged — it's an English brand acronym for **H**arness **Plan**ning and intentionally distinct from the lifecycle stage names.

New lifecycle: `hplan → discover → architect → deliver → measure → learn`

### Changed

- Plugin directories renamed (5 × `git mv`)
- All 6 `plugin.json` `name` fields updated; version bumped to 0.6.0
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` plugin entries renamed + descriptions refreshed
- README.md / README-ko.md / GUIDE-ko.md / CONTRIBUTING.md — every reference to the old plugin names updated
- Plugin lifecycle SVG (`docs/images/plugin-lifecycle.svg`) — box labels + lifecycle phase labels (Execution → Delivery, Monitoring → Measurement, Knowledge → Learning)
- How-it-works SVG (`docs/images/how-it-works.svg`) — plugin pills relabeled
- All SKILL.md "Route to Other Skills When" cross-references updated
- `validate_plugins.py` PLUGINS list updated

### Migration for existing users

Old install commands like `/plugin install oracle@kimsanguine-hplan` now become `/plugin install discover@kimsanguine-hplan`. GitHub auto-redirect handles old paths; users with installed plugins should re-install under the new name.

### Preserved (intentional)

- The Greek tier-name **`Atlas`** inside `architect/skills/3-tier/SKILL.md` — refers to the Prometheus → Atlas → Worker pattern, which is the *content* of the skill, not the plugin name. Mythology tier name remains.
- All historical CHANGELOG entries and `.archive/` work logs.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-05-11

### Added — `hplan` plugin (6th plugin, lifecycle Stage 0)

A new plugin that runs BEFORE oracle's discovery — the **Evidence + COGS + Decision gate** that decides whether the product deserves to be built at all.

**New skills (7) under `hplan/skills/`:**

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `evidence-rubric` | Score idea against 100-point evidence rubric (ICP / recent painful event / workaround / repetition / economic pain / switching trigger / MVP narrowness / acquisition path) |
| `interview-synthesis` | Import AI-clustered interview output (BuildBetter / Perspective / Granola / Otter), force human strength + Push/Pull/Habit/Anxiety axes tagging, audit 5/3 strong-Push rule |
| `exclusions` | Append-only Do-Not-Build registry with Korean-aware char-bigram fuzzy match + reopen_trigger |
| `cogs-sentinel` | Executable COGS gate — p50/p90 monthly margin via lognormal sampling, free-user abuse blend, GREEN/CONDITIONAL_GO/RED decision |
| `ost` | Generate Teresa Torres-style Opportunity Solution Tree with Mermaid + `docs/OPPORTUNITY_TREE.md` |
| `decision-log` | Append-only build/interview/pivot/hold log + 3-6 month self-eval audit (hit_rate, false_holds, missed_builds) |
| `handoff` | Multi-target Build Gate brief → Spec-Kit `specs/NNN-slug/`, Kiro `.kiro/specs/`, GStack `/office-hours`, Claude Code `AGENTS.md` + `CLAUDE.md` |

**New commands (6):**

- `/hplan-evidence`, `/hplan-product`, `/hplan-build`, `/hplan-cogs`, `/hplan-exclude`, `/hplan-handoff`

**Cross-cutting infrastructure:**

- `hplan/hplan_mcp/server.py` — MCP server exposing 6 hplan tools to Cursor / Windsurf / Kiro / Codex / Goose
- `hplan/hooks/gate_guard.py` — Claude Code PreToolUse hook blocking writes to PRD.md / spec.md / `specs/` / `.kiro/specs/` until `harness/build-gate/checkpoint.json` has `status: "approved"`
- `hplan/agents/` — 4 role-locked reviewer agents (evidence / product / economics / build)
- `hplan/references/` — 14 playbooks + `provider_pricing.json` (2026-05-11 snapshot)
- `hplan/scripts/` — 9 deterministic Python scripts

### Changed

- Lifecycle reordered: `hplan → oracle → atlas → forge → argus → muse`
- Marketplace version 0.4.0 → 0.5.0
- "36 skills, 5 plugins" → "43 skills, 6 plugins"
- Added `Route to hplan when ...` lines to 7 existing skills: `discover/cost-sim`, `discover/opp-tree`, `discover/hitl`, `discover/assumptions`, `discover/build-or-buy`, `deliver/prd`, `measure/burn-rate`
- README.md + README-ko.md top sections updated with hplan callout + 6-stage lifecycle table

### Fixed

- Removed accidentally committed `.git_broken/` directory (hundreds of git internals)
- Removed stale `EVAL_QUICK_REFERENCE.txt` (2026-03 internal note)

### Moved

- `todolist.md` → `.archive/2026-03-todolist.md`
- `progress.md` → `.archive/2026-03-progress.md`
- `eval_metrics.json` → `evals/pm-framework-baseline.json`
- `eval-workspace/` → `evals/workspace/`

## [1.0.0] — 2026-03-07

### v1.0 Structural Upgrade

Every skill now follows a consistent v1.0 structure that adds production-grade rigor on top of the original educational content.

**New sections in every SKILL.md:**

- **Core Goal** — 1-2 sentence purpose statement
- **Trigger Gate** — Use / Route / Boundary for accurate skill selection
- **Failure Handling** — table of failure → detection → fallback
- **Quality Gate** — self-check checklist before delivery
- **Examples** — good/bad output signals

### New Skills (3)

| Skill | Plugin | What it does |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `infographic-gif-creator` | forge | Animated infographic GIF/MP4 for agent architecture visualization |
| `pptx-ai-slide` | forge | Agent project presentation deck (pitch, review, investor) |
| `agent-demo-video` | forge | Remotion-based demo video for stakeholders |

### Stats

- **35 skills** (was 32), **12 commands**, **5 plugins**
- Trigger accuracy: 97.9% (94/96)
- Quality eval: with-skill 100% vs without-skill 88% (+12%)
- All 35 skills validated via `validate_plugins.py` — 0 errors, 0 warnings

### Documentation
