## [1.0.0] — 2026-03-07

### v1.0 Structural Upgrade

Every skill now follows a consistent v1.0 structure that adds production-grade rigor on top of the original educational content.

**New sections in every SKILL.md:**

- **Core Goal** — 1-2 sentence purpose statement
- **Trigger Gate** — Use / Route / Boundary for accurate skill selection
- **Failure Handling** — table of failure → detection → fallback
- **Quality Gate** — self-check checklist before delivery
- **Examples** — good/bad output signals

### New Skills (3)

| Skill | Plugin | What it does |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `infographic-gif-creator` | forge | Animated infographic GIF/MP4 for agent architecture visualization |
| `pptx-ai-slide` | forge | Agent project presentation deck (pitch, review, investor) |
| `agent-demo-video` | forge | Remotion-based demo video for stakeholders |
